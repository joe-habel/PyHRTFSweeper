# PyHRTFSweeper
A Python based implementation of HRTF that sweeps an audio file around the azimuth at a given frequency.

# CIPIC_hrtf_database
This implementation of hrtf makes use of the great data available from here https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/cipic/spatial-sound/hrtf-data/.

# Requirements

Along with the import requirements, this implementation requires both an ffmpeg and sox install, both of which need to be specified in the path variable.

For a simple demenstration simply call panner with the file you wish to sweep, along with the name of the new sweeped file.

# More detailed documentation coming down the line.
